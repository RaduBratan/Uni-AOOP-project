3. GameFactory
4. GameSingleton
5. ReviewData
6. ReviewDatabase
7. ReviewFactory
8. ReviewSingleton
9. UserData
10. UserDatabase

12. UserSingleton
13. DeveloperData
14. DeveloperDatabase

19. Main

#### Have/use:
- simple classes with private/protected attributes
- at least two different collections (e.g. List, Set, Map), out of which at least one of them should be sorted
- inheritance

## Requirements for part 2

1. Use a relational database along with JDBC (with create/read/update/delete operations for at least four of the defined classes; also, singleton services should be included)
2. Use an audit service (with .csv files)
